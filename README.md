# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects – Power Query, Python, SQL

Welcome to my **Data Cleaning Projects** repository!  
This collection showcases my journey in mastering **data preprocessing** and **wrangling** using industry-standard tools like **Power Query**, **Python (Pandas)**, and **SQL**. These projects form the foundation of my **data analysis skillset**, ensuring data is accurate, clean, and ready for meaningful insights.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power Query**
  - Applied Steps (Filter, Remove Errors, Replace Values)
  - M code transformations
  - Column splitting, pivot/unpivot, data type fixes

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `re`
  - Null value handling, string cleanup, datetime parsing
  - Outlier detection, duplicates removal

- **SQL**
  - `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CASE WHEN`, `JOIN`, `TRIM`, `CAST` and many more
  - Data type normalization
  - Schema validation and record-level corrections

## 📂 Sample Project Highlights

### 📊 Power Query: Sales Data Cleaning
- Removed nulls, fixed inconsistent region names
- Converted columns to correct formats (date, currency)
- Created calculated columns for reporting use

###  Python: Survey Data Cleanup
- Loaded raw CSV with inconsistent casing and typos
- Cleaned column names, standardized categories
- Imputed missing values and exported cleaned file

### 🧾 SQL: Customer Records Fix
- Removed trailing whitespaces and junk characters
- Handled missing join keys and filtered test data
- Merged lookup tables for clean final output

## 🎯 Why This Matters

> Clean data is the **foundation** of good analysis.

Through these projects, I practiced real-world scenarios of fixing messy datasets—an essential skill for **data analysts**, **BI developers**, and **data scientists**. These exercises prepared me for working on larger analytical dashboards and business reporting tasks.

## ✅ Future Goals

- Add **real-world data cleaning case studies**
- Include **unit testing in Python** for cleaning steps
- Explore **dbt for SQL data transformations**
